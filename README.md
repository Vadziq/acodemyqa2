#Why I`m trying to become an IT specialist?


**A little history**

Once, more than ten years ago, I was trying to become stock trader, now its funny, but then it was looking serious.
After finishing courses I was practiced for some time manually but, got not any positive results,
until I found that trading software called _**NinjaTrader**_ powerful enough and have possibility of automation using C# language.
So I liked the idea and started to learn basics.
In few months I was able to program actions of manual trading, so I got instrument to check strategy we learned on courses.
I downloaded year long history data of tick-by-tick market moving and applied my codes on it. 
Results was predictable, strategy was not working, just no one right situation to trade using indicators we learned on courses.
I was disappointed but kept trying to invent my own strategy, but it gave not any stable results and left the idea.
So finally I got some coding experience and nothing more.
My next meet with coding already related to my job. 
As an electricity automatics specialist I always close to electronic controllers,
and could not pass by such interesting toy as _Arduino_, it uses reduced C++ language for program. 
Playing with its I got some success that finally become to working industrial scaling and packing machine,
which uses master controller and 12 slave controllers connected with I2C network, so I become a bit more experienced.

**So why I`m trying to get into IT sphere?**

My job is often related to work in unpleasant places, touching dirty things, walking dirty wear etc.
I am getting older and would like to work in more comfortable conditions.
During all time I realized that most interesting parts of my jobs was programming,
so why not to try to  get into IT? Considering that salaries in that sphere at least similar or higher than I am able to get in my sphere. 
Really I am not sure that it is possible to get spectacular achievements in IT sphere starting aged 39 for me, but maybe it is not too late.
